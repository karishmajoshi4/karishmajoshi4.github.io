I am an Architecture, Planning and Design Professional and have worked in the industry for 2 years. I am skilled in AutoCAD, Land FX, Adobe Creative Suite, GIS, Sketchup, Microsoft Office, Site management, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Public Speaking and Inter-personal communication. I am an arts and design enthusiast with a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) focused in Architectural Design from University of Pune and currently pursuing a Masters in Landscape Architecture in Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.

For me, Architecture as a profession in itself is an opportunity to contribute to the well-being of society. By being a Landscape Architect I wish to make a significant contribution to the architectural fraternity and establish concepts that will be environmentally sustainable and socially pragmatic. I am interested in the sustainable master planning and design of commercial and retail landscapes and urban spaces and developing healthy livable resilient communities. My hobbies include, travelling and sketching and doodling on-site when I travel. In addition to it I am a foodie and always eager to explore different cuisines.
